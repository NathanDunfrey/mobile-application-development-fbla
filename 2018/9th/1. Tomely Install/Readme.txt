FBLA Tomely
Hello, my name is Vennela Gudlavenkatasiva and I was tasked to create a mobile app to manage the issuance of books and provide information on the school library. However, we were only able to create and test the app on Android devices. So currently, Tomely is not supported on IOS devices.
