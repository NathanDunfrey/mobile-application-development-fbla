              </Text>
              <Text>
                Tomely was developed in React Native to build cross platform
                Android & iOS mobile apps using ready to use generic components
                of React Native. Google's firebase realtime database was used to
                store the books and user data.

              </Text>
              <Text>
                Although Tomely was developed in React Native to run
                cross-platform on both Android & iOS, it was extensively tested
                and verified in Android. Currently, Tomely is not supported for
