      "The book and the plot aren’t bad, but I couldn’t find myself reading this ever again. Honestly the actions of the characters just seem very dumb, and I feel as though all the issues that were created were of the character’s creation. I understand it is just a story, but I often found myself screaming at the characters in my head because of the actions they took. Also, in my perspective, I don’t think of this book as a romantic tragedy but rather a satire on young love. While this is just what I think, I just don’t find this book good enough to try and take the time to carefully read (given it’s written in an olden form of English). ",

      "I love this book. It really does a great job of exemplifying how prominent of a role that the church played in early settlements like the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The sheer strength that the main character, Hester Prynne, showed in her situation, was just so inspirational and moving. I guess the only downfall of this book, is the abundance of over description, which wasn’t really necessary all the time.",

      "Do I even have to say how great of a book this is. This classical Shakespearean novel it literally everything, and I can find myself reading this book over and over and over again. It’s just so captivating, and such a well written piece of literature.",

      "I was assigned to read this book in my English class, and I thought it was going to be like something out of an old history book. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised by the storyline, and I honestly found this book to be a genuinely good read. Having heard about this book in every English class ever, I never bothered to read it, but it’s good. Yet, it’s encompasses a lot of deep ideas, and as a reader, you need to be mature because the book addresses sensitive topics like racism, to build upon the plot and to the coming-of-age theme.",

      "This book is definitely something. I honestly found it to be a very worth-while read and surely do recommend it. But, the book is quite heavy in terms of the plot and storyline. It is by far, the strongest novel I have ever read because many different issues are addressed here. There is some kind of sexual violence, incest, marital abuse, or racism on the flip of every page, and as a reader you kind of get a sense of the pain that the characters/protagonist is going through. But, past that, it’s such a good book that showcases the strength of the main character as she goes on to bigger and better things despite everything she has gone through.",

      "This book is so great book, and no set number of words can describe how amazing it is. While there are a lot of deep topics, I just found this book to be so great because I got to see the main character grow and go on to pursue everything she ever wanted even though she was abused. Truly exemplary, and a great feministic piece.",

      "EVERYONE should honestly read this book. It’s such a classic, and it can NEVER get old. It truly takes me back to the roaring 20’s in America when there was such a fine line between the rich and the poor. In just 180 pages, this novel had me speechless. I literally have no words….100% recommend.",
