However, it's not cheap to attend FBLA Nationals. Members have to take into account the conference ticket, living accommodations, and food. Picket was built to solve this issue and enable FBLA chapters to reduce the amount of money needed to go to Nationals. Picket is a platform to help FBLA chapters fundraise money for Nationals through a digital yard sale. Users can easily add and bid on items through Picket's intuitive user interface.Picket is an iOS app built ground-up with the Swift 3.0 programming language. Various open-source frameworks were used to create an immersive user interface and third-party SDKs (Software Development Kits), such as Firebase, were used to expedite the app creation process. On the business side of Picket, the plan is to license the app to chapters. The current version is specifically for Taylor FBLA. FAQ---Q: How do I delete my item?A: By simply clicking on your item, you will see an option to delete your item. This option is only visible to you to ensure a smooth and secure experience for our users.

Q: Why is there a purple checkmark next to a name?A: A purple checkmark next to a name indicates that the account is used by an actual FBLA chapter rather than an individual. Q: How do I share this campaign to raise awareness of Taylor FBLA’s online yard sale fundraiser?A: On the main page, on the right side, there is an yellow ‘quick action’ button that allows you to post this campaign on social medias such as Facebook and Twitter to increase awareness about Taylor FBLA’s online yard sale fundraiser. You can write your own message when speaking awareness or use a preset message.Q: How does Taylor FBLA earn money from Picket?A: 20% of the earnings that a user receives by selling an item through Picket will go to lessen the financial burden on Taylor FBLA to send its members to FBLA Nationals.Q: Do I need to give my credit card information?A: No credit card information will be needed to purchase/bid an item. If the seller accepts your bid, you will receive a notification with the item’s information and you will physically hand in the money to the seller. The purpose behind this is to promote more social interaction between club members and the community. This will help to strengthen the bond between club members and also raise awareness about Taylor FBLA in the community.

Q: How can a I interact with an Item?A: If a user posts an item they will be able to ‘see offers’ and ‘delete item’. These actions are available only to the owners of the item being sold. If you are looking at an item that was not posted by you, you will be able to ‘share item’, ‘contact seller’, and ‘make offer’. These actions are only available to the buyer. I will be keeping some items owned by the Test Account in order for you to interact with items through the “owner” point of view. Information to access the Test Account can be found below.REQUIREMENTS------------An iOS device (iOS 9 or higher) or iOS emulator•      The device must be able to take a picture or upload a picture file, hence the use of a iOS simulator is not advised for camera use.•      This app is optimized for iOS capable devices (any screen size). This app is for iPhone only. It will run best on an iPhone 5s, SE, 6, 6s, 7 due to the screen size.Xcode 8.3.2•      This version of Xcode (or newer) is required to run the app since it supports Swift 3.1.1. INSTALLATION------------•      This application is not available on the App Store•      Must be run through Xcode 8.3.2 via an iPhone Emulator or a connected device CONFIGURATION-------------•      Configure user permissions in the Settings application on your device•      Permissions	•      Access to camera/camera roll	•      Access to internet (Wi-Fi)


TEST ACCOUNT
------------
NOTE: To use the app, you will need to make a Picket account. You can either make a new account with your own credentials, or use the Testing Account with the credentials below:

Test Account Credentials (This account had already been made, simply login with the email and password)

Name: FBLA Tester
Email: fblatester@gmail.com
Password: fblatester

With the Testing Account I will be keeping some items already posted with which you will be able to interact with. Some of these items will be posted by the Testing Account and some will be posted by other accounts.
 INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING PROJECT--------------------------------NOTE: Xcode 8.3.2 or newer is required to run Picket since it supports the latest version of the Swift programming language, 3.1.1. In order to use the camera, the app will need to be run on a physical iPhone.

NOTE: In order to run the app on a physical iPhone, you will need to create a provisioning profile and an Apple Developer ID as a result of Apple’s development process. This can be managed by clicking Xcode > Preferences > Accounts in the tab bar. This can also be settled by visiting https://developer.apple.com/ to learn how to set up a Developer ID. The simplest way to run the app will to run the file through the native iOS simulator. To run Picket on the Apple iOS Simulator:Find and open the Xcode Project, denoted by the "Picket.xcworkspace”. To choose a device, click the drop down menu located to the right of the stop button. The iPhone SE and iPhone 7 is the best choice. Then simply click the the play button at the top left corner when Xcode opens the project. CAUTION: If the simulator is used to test the app, the camera will not work due to the lack of a camera ability in the iOS simulator. To test the camera feature of the app, download and run Picket on to a physical iPhone as instructed below.To run Picket on a physical iPhone:First download the Xcode file project. When opened, find and open the file Xcode Project, denoted by the name “Picket.xcworkspace”. Simply click the the play button at the top left corner when Xcode opens the project. Attach any iOS capable device with iOS 9 or above. When you are prompted for a device to use select the device you have attached to automatically run Picket on your phone. Make sure that any prompts are accepted and the file is allowed to run. You may need to go to settings and make sure that the computer being used has permission to run application on the mobile device. NOTE: In order to run Picket on an iPhone, you may need to get a provisioning profile or an apple developer profile.TROUBLESHOOTING---------------•      If the application takes an unnatural time to respond (over 5 seconds) it may be due to Wi-Fi connection•      Files other than images may not be uploaded onto the application SOFTWARE USED-------------The integrated development environment (IDE) was Xcode, which accompanies the default Apple Simulator. To design the app and icon and assets, I used Sketch due to its versatility. The Swift 3.0 programming language was used to develop the app.SOURCES OF INFORMATION----------------------To get acquainted with Apple's new programming language, Swift 3.0, I used a wide variety of resources. I used a Udemy course that covered iOS development and basic practices to make immersive apps. In addition to that, I used the iTunes Education Stanford Course over iOS development to get a grasp of MVC architecture. Beyond those courses, I used Stack Overflow's free public forums and several websites such as Ray Wenderlich and Youtube channels to learn new concepts and fix errors.COPYRIGHT NOTATIONS-------------------The following open-source frameworks were used:•      Cocoapods (https://cocoapods.org/) was used for managing dependencies.•      ImagePicker (https://github.com/hyperoslo/ImagePicker) was used to display an elegant camera in the app.•      TPKeyboardAvoiding (https://github.com/michaeltyson/TPKeyboardAvoiding) to make sure that the keyboard does not cover any information field.•      SwiftMessages (https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages) was used to display beautiful alerts.
•	Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/) was used to handle user authentication and database management.
The following SDKs (Sofware Development Kit) were used:•      Facebook iOS SDK (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/)•      Firebase iOS SDK (https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)TEMPLATES USED---------------No templates were used in building the Picket app, just open-source frameworks to create an immersive and intuitive user interface.MAINTAINERS-----------•      Yash Kakodkar INFORMATION SOURCES-------------------•      Stack Overflow•      Udemy•      Firebase API iOS Docs (https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)•      CodeWithChris YouTube Tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/user/CodeWithChris)
